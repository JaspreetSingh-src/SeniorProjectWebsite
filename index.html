				<h3 class="darkblue">Background</h3>
				<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
					<a href="https://californiaactiveshootertraining.com/" style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF9500"> California Active Shooter Preparedness Training</a>
					founded by Mr. Lindon Lilly provides training tools in areas such as active shooter
					response, prevention of workplace violence and sexual harassment, and human trafficking awareness. The purpose of this project
					is to create state-of-the-art workplace violence prevention virtual training software for employers to offer their employees and
					create a safe work environment.<br>

				</p>

				<h3 class="darkblue">Scope</h3>
				<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
					The client needs a web application that can be accessed all over California online to help train different organizations with custom education modules.
					The project developed will help the product owner create an educational curriculum for different business partners and clients to be prepared for various
					workplace violence scenarios and possibilities.
				</p>
				<p>	
					The project goal is to develop a web application that trains client's and business partner's employees on safety concern beyond active shooter preparedness
					to prevent problems in the workplace and create compliance with CAL/OSHA.<br>

				</p>

				<h3 class="darkblue">Proposed Solution</h3>
				<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
					The team will create a web based application that allows users to complete the training modules. The administrator will have the privilege to manage the content and track users' progress.<br>

				</p>

				<h3 class="darkblue">Highlights</h3>
				<p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
					The project will help improve workplace/school safety regarding workplace violence, bullying and harrasment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our project will provide the client a customized web application and user friendly interface to users' and the adminstrator.
					It will have video based training modules to keep the users engaged.<br>

				<h1>Semester 2</h1>
				
				<h3 class="darkblue">Semester Starts</h3>
				
				<p>
					Implementing our project this semester would take a lot of work. We would have to learn
					how to use the MERN stack. This is a web friendly javascript open source based technology stack.
					The stack provides a framework for end to end development. We chose this because it's a proven 
					way of building web applications from front-end to back-end. 
				</p>
				<p>
					MERN is an acronym that stands for 
					MongoDB, Expressjs, Reactjs, and Nodejs. MongoDb is a NoSQL document based database that uses JSON 
					type objects for storing schema-less data. Express is a server-side framework for Node applications
					that can help build APIs for accessing endpoints. React is a front-end library that is used to build
					stateful components for creating user interfaces. Nodejs is a cross platform runtime enviroment that 
					allows you to execute javascript outside of a browser on and create scalable network applications. 
					This web technology stack was used to build an end to end 3-tier system based on the client-server model.
				</p>
				
				<h3 class="darkblue">Agile Scrum</h3>
				
				<p>
					In our software development process we used the Agile project management methodology to help facilitate 
					our completion of the web application. Using this iterative life cycle we mades several changes to 
					both the software functionality and user interface. This was done in accordance to our client 
					Mr. Lindon Lilly. At the end of each sprint during the client meetings we were able to discuss and 
					create new changes. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Mr. Lindon no longer needed a content creation interface and was going to offer this course to organizations 
					for free. This means the ecommerce component would be taken out and the Stripe API would not charge customers 
					for using the applicaiton and taking the course. The web application will focus on training for schools with 
					curriculum k - 12. The content was also changed with several iterations upon demonstration of how it would 
					look to prospective customers. Overall the Agile methodology helped create a web application that was right 
					on target with the clients expectations.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<h3 class="darkblue">Cloud Deployment</h3>
				
				<p>
					Customers should be able to access the client's web application from anywhere. Per software specification 
					requirements the web application was to be deployed on the cloud. We chose an economical solution to cloud 
					computing where the client wouldn't need to be computer tech savvy or be I.T. trained to be able to maintain 
					the web application. After doing our due diligence we chose Digital Ocean due to its easy of use, 
					cost effectiveness, and Virtual Private Servers.
					
				<br>
				<br>

				</p>
				
				<h3 class="darkblue">Conclusion</h3>
				
				<p>
					At the conclusion of the semester the project was finished along with the user and maintenance manuals. 
					Our client was given the code base and instructions on how to run and maintain the web application. This 
					was a learning experience and helpful. Our group learned and implemented the Agile methodology which 
					increased our productivity and client satisfaction. We learned how to implement the MERN stack and the 
					technologies it uses. We learned that everyones role in a project counts and everyone can use help. Time 
					constraints, lack of knowledge, workload, life balance, and learning curves can hinder progress but with 
					a strong team these obstacles can be overcome.
